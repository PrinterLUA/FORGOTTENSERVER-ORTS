**If you want to contribute by sending pull request, here are some tips.
Try to use metatables in your script. Ex.**
```lua
function metaExample(cid)
	local player = Player(cid)
	if player ~= nil then
		player:addItem(2160, 5)
		player:sendTextMessage(MESSAGE_STATUS_CONSOLE_BLUE, "Here is some cash.")
	end
end
```
**How non meta looks like:**
```lua
function nonMetaExample(cid)
	if isPlayer(cid) then
		doPlayerAddItem(cid, 2160, 5)
		doPlayerSendTextMessage(cid, MESSAGE_STATUS_CONSOLE_BLUE, "Here is some cash.")
	end
end
```

**NOTE:**
Since the link above dosen't have all the functions in it, I will link to a compat.lua file(can be found in your ot aswell, dir/data/compat.lua), use ctrl+f and enter the old function then press enter.
